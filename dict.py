    'text': """The Hubble Space Telescope (often referred to as HST or Hubble) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) controls the spacecraft. \n
    Hubble features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe.

    'text': """The Kepler space telescope is a disused space telescope launched by NASA
      in 2009 to discover Earth-sized planets orbiting other stars. Named after
      astronomer Johannes Kepler, the spacecraft was launched into an
      Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. The principal investigator was William
      J. Borucki. After nine and a half years of operation, the telescope's
      reaction control system fuel was depleted, and NASA announced its
      retirement on October 30, 2018. Designed to survey a portion of Earth's
      region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-size exoplanets in or near
      habitable zones and estimate how many of the billions of stars in the
      Milky Way have such planets, Kepler's sole scientific instrument is a
      photometer that continually monitored the brightness of approximately
      150,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. These data were
      transmitted to Earth, then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by
      exoplanets that cross in front of their host star. Only planets whose
      orbits are seen edge-on from Earth could be detected. Kepler observed
      530,506 stars and detected 2,662 planets.""",

    'text': """The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope which conducts infrared astronomy. As the largest optical telescope in space, its high resolution and sensitivity allow it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope.[8] This will enable investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University operates JWST, and the prime contractor was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.""",
