    <div class="title">Hubble Space telescope</div>
    <div class="info_text_formatting">
      Launched in 1990, Hubble has been visited by astronauts four times in
      order to make repairs and add new instruments. Each instrument that flies
      on Hubble has special features that let astronomers study the heavens in
      different ways. Hubble's unique capabilities can also be partnered with
      other space observatories and those on the ground to enable scientists to
      explore the universe in ways that no single mission could ever accomplish
      alone.

    <div class="title">Hubble Space telescope programs</div>
    <div class="info_text_formatting">
      Since the start of the program, a number of research projects have been
      carried out, some of them almost solely with Hubble. Although the Hubble
      observatory is nearing the end of its life, there are still major projects
      scheduled for it. One example is the current (2022) ULLYSES project
      (Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards) which
      will last for three years to observe a set of high- and low-mass young
      stars and will shed light on star formation and composition.

    <div class="title">Introducing Hubble's ULLYSES Program</div>
    <div class="info_text_formatting">
      For centuries, astronomers have studied the stars, gathering information
      about their precise positions and compositions to learn how they form. But
      it wasn't until telescopes were launched into space that we could begin to
      capture some of the most important information - which is delivered by
      ultraviolet light.

    <div class="title">Kepler Exoplanet Mission</div>
    <div class="info_text_formatting">
      Kepler was a space telescope designed to survey a portion of the Milky Way
      galaxy in search of exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar
      system.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="title">Objectives and methods</div>
    <div class="info_text_formatting">
      The scientific objective of the Kepler space telescope was to explore the
      structure and diversity of planetary systems. This spacecraft observes a
      large sample of stars to achieve several key goals:
    </div>
    <div class="ul_container">
      <ul>
        <li>
          To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or
          near the habitable zone (often called "Goldilocks planets") of a wide
          variety of spectral types of stars.
        </li>
        <li>
          To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these
          planets.
        </li>
        <li>
          To estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and
          density of short-period giant planets.
        </li>
        <li>
          To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system
          using other techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="title">The Transit Method</div>
    <div class="info_text_formatting">
      The transit method is by far the most utilized strategy in finding
      exoplanets, and the recent launch of NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey
      Satellite (TESS) is direct result of this method’s success. The concept is
      relatively simple: astronomers can observe the periodic dimming of a
      star’s brightness caused by an exoplanet passing between the star and
      Earth.
